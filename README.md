RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation is a valuable method for categorizing customers into distinct clusters based on their purchase behavior. This approach helps businesses gain insights into customer segments and tailor marketing efforts. This guide introduces the process of performing RFM segmentation in Tableau, creating four distinct customer clusters and a fifth cluster for "Others" to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

Data Preparation

    Import the online retail dataset into Tableau, ensuring it includes relevant transaction data.

Data Exploration

    Examine the dataset to identify any data quality issues and clean them as necessary.

RFM Calculation

    Calculate Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M) for each customer.

Assigning RFM Scores

    Assign numerical scores to customers based on quantiles or percentiles for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.

RFM Segmentation

    Define criteria for segmenting customers into clusters based on their RFM scores.
    Use calculated fields to allocate customers to the appropriate clusters.

Cluster Visualization

    Create a Tableau dashboard to visualize customer segments using RFM scores.
    Employ Tableau's visualizations to illustrate the distribution of customers across clusters.

Interpretation

    Analyze the RFM segmentation results to gain insights into customer behavior.
    Understand the characteristics of each cluster and their potential business value.
